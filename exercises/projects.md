# Exercise: Browse Past Projects 

For this exercise, we'd like you to explore some sample projects from the last few semesters. The project names and numbers have changed a bit over time, so pay attention to the short descriptions at the top of each section to understand which project you're looking at.  If you find a project that is especially interesting or if you have questions about expectations for this semester, feel free to mention it in the "#exercise-discussion" Slack channel.

## Do the following:
- Check out the links below and visit at least one project in each category.
- Watch the Projects Overview Video also linked to from the first week's myCourses content area.
