# Exercise: Structural and Semantic HTML 

Don't forget to ask for help if needed.  Don't spend a lot of time (especially in the in-person lab) being stuck.

## Do as much of the following as possible:

1. Continue with your previous (freshly valid!) in-class exercise.

    - Add `<hr>` between sections

    - Add appropriate additional `<h2>`, `<h3>`

    - Turn the Publishing Information and Game Genre Information into two separate Unordered Lists

    - Add a blockquote for the review excerpt.

1. Confirm that all of the above have worked (they all have a visible effect).

1. Add organizing/semantic tags:

    - Add a `<main>` section. What section is "main"... (hint: most if not all of it)
    - Add a `<header>` section. What info is in your header?
    - Add a `<footer>` with information about where the content is from.

1. Add inline elements for additional formatting (your choice as to where they might be appropriate):
    - Italics (for emphasis), 
    - Bold (for strong meaning), 
    - Mark an acronym so that it's meaning appears on hover.  
    - Add a line break.

1. Add a `<div>` with an `id` attribute around the "source" info at the very bottom of the page.
    - We won't apply any styling to it just yet, we're just making it so that we can link to it from the next exercise.
